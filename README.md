#### Investing Strategies / Features
- Momentum trading (in simple terms):
    - Investing in stocks that have increased in price the most. 
    - We assess the price changes over the last 12 months, excluding the past month, and select the stock with the highest recent price return over the last year, as the preferred investment.
- Value trading (in simple terms):
    - Investing in stocks that are trading below their true value (appears undervalued)
    - A concept called 'Multiples' is used to estimate how valuable a company is.
        - P/E Ratio is a common example of a Multiple.  
    - "You must value the business in order to value the stock." ~ Charlie Munger.
